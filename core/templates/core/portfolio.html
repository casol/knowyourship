                            HNLMS Abraham Crijnssen was a Jan van Amstel-class
                            minesweeper of the Royal Netherlands Navy (RNN).
                            Built during the 1930s, she was based in the Netherlands East Indies
                            when Japan attacked at the end of 1941. Ordered to retreat to Australia,
                            the ship was disguised as a tropical island to avoid detection,
                            and was the last Dutch ship to escape from the region.
                            On arriving in Australia in 1942, she was commissioned into
                            the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) as HMAS Abraham Crijnssen and operated
                            as an anti-submarine escort. Although returned to RNN control in 1943,
                            the ship remained in Australian waters for most of World War II. After the war,
                            Abraham Crijnssen operated on anti-revolution patrols in the East Indies,
                            before returning to the Netherlands and being converted into a boom defence ship
                            in 1956. Removed from service in 1960, the vessel was donated to the Netherlands
                            Sea Cadet Corps for training purposes. In 1995, Abraham Crijnssen was acquired
                            by the Dutch Navy Museum for preservation as a museum ship.
